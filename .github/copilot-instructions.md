# Copilot Instructions for CITT_1300 Web Design Projects

## Project Overview
This repository contains beginner-level web design projects for learning HTML5 and CSS. The structure is organized by project, with each project in its own folder. Example projects include:
- `intro-html/`: Simple HTML introduction, inline CSS, and basic content
- `html5-css/`: HTML5 structure, external CSS, and image usage

## Directory Structure
- `intro-html/` — Standalone HTML project with inline styles
- `html5-css/` — HTML5 project using external CSS (`css/styles.css`) and images (`images/`)
- `README.md` — Project links and navigation

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- Use semantic HTML5 tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc.) in `html5-css/`
- External CSS is linked via `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">` in `html5-css/index.html`
- Images are stored in the `images/` subfolder of each project
- Inline CSS is used only in `intro-html/index.html` for demonstration
- Navigation is handled with simple `<a>` tags; no JavaScript or frameworks

## Developer Workflow
- No build or test steps; edit HTML/CSS directly and open in browser
- To preview, open the HTML files directly (e.g., `intro-html/index.html` or `html5-css/index.html`)
- No external dependencies or package managers

## Project-Specific Notes
- All content is static; there is no backend or dynamic scripting
- File and folder names are lowercase and use hyphens for separation
- Keep HTML and CSS simple and readable for educational purposes

## Example: Adding a New Project
1. Create a new folder (e.g., `project-name/`)
2. Add `index.html` and any assets (e.g., `css/`, `images/`)
3. Link the new project in `README.md` using a relative path
